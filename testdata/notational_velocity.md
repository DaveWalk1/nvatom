# Notational Velocity

NOTATIONAL VELOCITY is an application that stores and retrieves notes.

It is an attempt to loosen the mental blockages to recording information and to scrape away the tartar of convention that handicaps its retrieval. The solution is by nature nonconformist.

## Unique Characteristics

- __Modeless Operation__: Searching for notes is not a separate action; rather, it is the primary interface.
- __Incremental Search__: Searching encompasses all notes' content and occurs instantly with each key pressed.
- __Transparent Database Encryption__: All content is compressed and encrypted (enabled optionally) before it is recorded to disk.
- __Mouseless Interaction__: Notational Velocity's window was designed for keyboard input above all else, and thus has no buttons.
- __Data Instead of Documents__: There is no manual "saving" in Notational Velocity; all modifications take effect immediately.
- __Complete External Access__: Synchronize natively with Simplenote, or via files in Dropbox with PlainText, Elements, iA Writer, and other iOS apps.
