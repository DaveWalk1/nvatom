# Notational Velocity for Atom

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/seongjaelee/notational-velocity.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/seongjaelee/notational-velocity)

[Notational Velocity][1] is an application that stores and retrieves notes. This Atom package implements the some key features from this amazing app:

- Modeless operation
- Mouseless interaction
- Incremental Search

Integrated with Atom, we have many advantages:

- __Use Atom's Features__ - Such as Syntax Highlighting and Tree View.
- __Use Other Packages__ - Such as Markdown Preview and Minimap.
- __Multi-OS__ - You can use it in Linux and Windows.

We do believe Notational Velocity is the precursor of the famous note-taking app Evernote. Advantages over Evernote are:

- __Open Source__
- __No Rich Text__ - Instead, we strongly recommend to use [Markdown][2].
- __No Cloud Sync__ - You pick whichever syncing method you prefer.

## Settings

- `Directory`: The directory of archiving markdown files.

## Key Bindings

- `ctrl-alt-o`: Toggles the search view.
