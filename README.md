# nvatom is unpublished from https://atom.io

It has been longer than a year since this package has not been maintained properly. I don't think I can keep with Atom's development cycle. I also faced a performance issue as the size of text files grow, making this package less and less usable.

I also appologize the ambiguous naming for `nvatom`, which is short for Notational Velocity for Atom. Zachary Schneirov, the creator of [Notation Velocity][1], contacted me that some people may mistakenly believe that this package is an official component or sub-project of Notational Velocity. I want to make it clear that __this project was NOT affiliated with Notational Velocity__.

Thanks a lot for your interests and contributions.
